# terraform-aws-iam-role [![Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/cloudposse%2Fterraform-aws-iam-role%2Flint?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role/lint) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


A Terraform module that creates IAM role with provided JSON IAM polices documents.

#### Warning

* If `var.enabled` set `false` the module can be used as [IAM Policy Document Aggregator](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-policy-document-aggregator)
because [`output.policy`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role/tree/init#outputs) always aggregates [`var.policy_documents`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role/tree/init#inputs)
* List size [`var.policy_documents`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role/tree/init#inputs) [limited to 10](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-policy-document-aggregator#inputs)

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role/releases).


This example creates a role with the name `cp-prod-app` with permission to grant read-write access to S3 bucket,
and gives permission to the entities specified in `principals_arns` to assume the role.

```hcl

  data "aws_iam_policy_document" "resource_full_access" {
    statement {
      sid       = "FullAccess"
      effect    = "Allow"
      resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/path/*"]

      actions = [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
      ]
    }
  }

  data "aws_iam_policy_document" "base" {
    statement {
      sid = "BaseAccess"

      actions = [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketVersions",
      ]

      resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::bucketname"]
      effect    = "Allow"
    }
  }

  module "role" {
    source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-role.git?ref=master"

    enabled    = "true"
    namespace = "cp"
    stage     = "prod"
    name      = "app"

    policy_description = "Allow S3 FullAccess"
    role_description   = "IAM role with permissions to perform actions on S3 resources"

    principals = {
      AWS = ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/workers"]
    }

    policy_documents = [
      "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.resource_full_access.json}",
      "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.base.json}",
    ]
  }
```
